## For an in-depth overview of this project, please visit see the Project Specifications [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJVGoa_NgvcgVSf7SO_GYjiI3xnwLEg0HcXH62ddwUE/edit?usp=sharing).

## FINAL_VERSION.hipc is an aptly-named tool that includes the final version of my undergraduate senior design project. It contains a tool that can be used to texture teapots in cool ways!

## ReactionDiffusionPlayground.hipc is an educational tool featuring only the reaction-diffusion algorithm. This was modified from the original tool for the University of Pennsylvania's Procedural Graphics Course, Fall 2022.
